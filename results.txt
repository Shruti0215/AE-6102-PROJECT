Result and Observations 

1. The time taken by backtracking method increased significantly as value of n increases 
     n=2, time = 0.0003757476806640625
     n=3, time = 0.0007798671722412109
     n=4, time = 0.0036439895629882812
     
2. The main reason for above observation was recursion which was consuming a lot of time 

3. so we implmented no recursion with numba , but output was not significant due to low FLOP count
